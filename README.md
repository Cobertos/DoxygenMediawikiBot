### FAQ:

#### Why do some page names have '!' characters in them?

Page titles in MediaWiki are not allowed to contain a few characters for example '<', '>', and '?'.
To compensate for this all invalid characters are changed to '!'s and '_'s to ' ' by MediaWiki default
MediaWiki's `{{DISPLAYTITLE:_}}` magic word is also used when available to show the correct page title on the page (but the actual page link and title in the database will contain '!'s)
