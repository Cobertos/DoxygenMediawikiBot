#Todo:
#Fix the infobox

#Stuff I'd like to add but probably won't (not worth the effort for the gain at the current time):
#Handle old documents that are deleted better (perhaps present a message if a transclusion is detected or add their transclusions to a category)
#Make the doxymwbot infobox use the same styles as media wikis contents box so we don't have to duplicate styles & Add a "[hide]" thing to the doxymw info box
#Checks to see if user has privileges (we just assume they do)
#We add docs to the nav category unless transclusions are made, we add those instead (this is so that the nav categories can be used for navigating the docs)
#    The problem is that the documentation will never actually have a navCategory tag and users have to use the infobox which might not be the most intuitive
#    We'd have to make fake categories for the documentation that redirects to the real categories which is populated with transclusions if we want this work (not work the effort tho)
#Make categories and things that involve cross page references (aside from pages that generate more than one page, and those references) the responsibility of the site
#   This then allows the responsbility of how we structure everything over the site to be the site's responsibility (important for deleting)
#Make sure that we can take pages and stick them in empty objects (like an __init__ for just pages), so we can properly .delete pages
#   References the chang before it in thislist. Also remove special in generator because its messing up theway we make everything
#Unimplemented stuff in global
#fix all the TODOS in the code
#The javascript for the box hiding?
#Add back the ...*...... progress bar in doxymw.py instead of the "converting: ___"

#Note:
#I'd rather not worry about integrating with current documentation on a and just stick to making everything in our own bubble and having the user populate it from
#If we REALLY want to integrate, then we could specify a new command for that. Otherwise, just don't touch transclusions (or other pages) that already exist
