#Todo:
#Add doxygen styles to the mediawiki common css or something

#Better Category management
#Define specific DoxygenHTMLPages that dont show up in the external category (For members pages in extern category)
#make sure we don't update transExternCategory, only create it (possibly in the bottom task, add a flag if we're allow to touch it or not? FLAG ADDED!)

#Stick the inheritance image in a little box and make the little thing a caption on it (the "This is an inheritance diagram of...")

#The javascript for the box hiding?

#fix all the TODOS in the code
#Replace old docs that have one transclusion somewhere else with a message? (If we can even do that)
#Improve output so that it doesn't look like piss

#Stuff I'd like to add but probably won't (not worth the effort for the gain at the current time):
#Checks to see if user has privileges (we just assume they do)
#Add a "[hide]" thing to the doxymw info box
#Make the doxymwbot infobox use the same styles as media wikis contents box so we don't have to duplicate styles
#Harmonize documentation (specifically the usage, the user page, the readme)
#Update specific things on transclusion pages, like categories (something that doesnt harm the content?) if we need to? (make categories get included from transclusions!!?)

#Changed in next commit:
#Fix the transclusion template listed on the transclusion page
#More robust title normalization
#A bot user page
#Make sure the "delete old pages" works because it compares to title() and not title(underscores=True) (SHOULD BE FIXED, with new normilization)
