#Todo:
#Better Category management
#Stick the inheritance image in a little box and make the little thing a caption on it (the "This is an inheritance diagram of...")

#Add the doxygen logo and compilation time to the footer
#Add note in al documentation on lack of affiliation from Doxygen

#Add doxygen styles to the mediawiki common css or something

#The javascript for the box hiding?

#Add doxygen bot user description >:]
#make sure we don't update transExternCategory, only create it (possibly in the bottom task, add a flag if we're allow to touch it or not?)

#fix all the TODOS in the code
#Replace old docs that have one transclusion somewhere else with a message? (If we can even do that)
#Define specific DoxygenHTMLPages that dont show up in the external category
#Update specific things on transclusion pages, like categories (something that doesnt harm the content?) if we need to? (make categories get included from transclusions!!?)
#Make sure the "delete old pages" works because it compares to title() and not title(underscores=True)

#Stuff I'd like to add but probably won't:
#Checks to see if user has privileges (we just assume they do)
#Add a "[hide]" thing to the doxymw info box
