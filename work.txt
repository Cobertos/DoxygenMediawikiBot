#Todo:
#Better category management?

#Add doxygen styles to the mediawiki common css or something
#Add user page (actually add it to site)

#Stick the inheritance image in a little box and make the little thing a caption on it (the "This is an inheritance diagram of...")
#The javascript for the box hiding?

#fix all the TODOS in the code
#Improve output so that it doesn't look like piss
#Harmonize documentation (specifically the usage, the user page, the readme)(Also let users know about title normalization and how it affects them)

#Stuff I'd like to add but probably won't (not worth the effort for the gain at the current time):
#Handle old documents that are deleted better (perhaps present a message if a transclusion is detected or add their transclusions to a category)
#Make the doxymwbot infobox use the same styles as media wikis contents box so we don't have to duplicate styles & Add a "[hide]" thing to the doxymw info box
#Checks to see if user has privileges (we just assume they do)

#I'd rather not worry about integrating with current documentation and just stick to making everything in our own bubble and having the user populate it from
#If we REALLY want to integrate, then we could specify a new command for that. Otherwise, just don't touch transclusions (or other pages) that already exist


#Changed in next update:
#Removed template appending functionality
#Removed external category
#Added navCategory
#Moved docs type categories to navCategory
#Option to exclude MembersList from main navCategory
#Added canEdit=False to navCategories (so we can create them but not overwrite them if they exist)
