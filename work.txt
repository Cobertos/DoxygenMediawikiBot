#Todo:
#Make sure cleanup is up to date

#Add a .deletePage to all page classes (so we know how to delete something we made)
#Add doxygen styles to the mediawiki common css or something

#Stick the inheritance image in a little box and make the little thing a caption on it (the "This is an inheritance diagram of...")
#The javascript for the box hiding?

#fix all the TODOS in the code
#Improve output so that it doesn't look like piss
#Harmonize documentation (specifically the usage, the user page, the readme)(Also let users know about title normalization and how it affects them)

#Stuff I'd like to add but probably won't (not worth the effort for the gain at the current time):
#Handle old documents that are deleted better (perhaps present a message if a transclusion is detected or add their transclusions to a category)
#Make the doxymwbot infobox use the same styles as media wikis contents box so we don't have to duplicate styles & Add a "[hide]" thing to the doxymw info box
#Checks to see if user has privileges (we just assume they do)
#We add docs to the nav category unless transclusions are made, we add those instead (this is so that the nav categories can be used for navigating the docs)
#    The problem is that the documentation will never actually have a navCategory tag and users have to use the infobox which might not be the most intuitive
#    We'd have to make fake categories for the documentation that redirects to the real categories which is populated with transclusions if we want this work (not work the effort tho)

#Note:
#I'd rather not worry about integrating with current documentation and just stick to making everything in our own bubble and having the user populate it from
#If we REALLY want to integrate, then we could specify a new command for that. Otherwise, just don't touch transclusions (or other pages) that already exist


#Changed in next update:
#Better category management (if I can get this right it'll cut down on so much shit in doxymwpage)
#Added user page
#Cleaned up links in infobox
