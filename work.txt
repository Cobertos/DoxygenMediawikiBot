#Todo:
#Update specific things on transclusion pages, like categories (something that doesnt harm the content?) if we need to?
#make sure we don't update transExternCategory, only create it (possibly in the bottom task, add a flag if we're allow to touch it or not?)
#Add the doxygen logo and compilation time to the footer
#Add doxygen styles to the mediawiki common css or something
#Add doxygen bot user description >:]
#Add sort key to categories
#Have the bot add a note with which type it is on the page (file, class, interface, namespace, etc, if it's not prominent)
#fix all the TODOS in the code
#Clone doxygen's easy navigation with some templates for mediawiki? maybe
#Option for deleting old docs right away or leaving them around for one "update"(as is currently the default)
